- 👋 Hi, I’m @moedman
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, Golang, Javascript, React.js and Node.js
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. Still learning and looking at code written by people who know what they are doing.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I can't help with anything yet, so you probably won't need to contact me.
